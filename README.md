# GraphQL Backend

## Background Context

In this project, we create an application using GraphQL, a query language designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.

* Create the back-end using ExpressJS and set up GraphQL, including schema, root query, and resolve functions.
* Connect the back-end to MongoDB and test your queries to the GraphQL server using GraphiQL.
* Build the front-end using ReactJS and the Apollo GraphQL client.
